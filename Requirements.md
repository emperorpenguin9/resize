      /**
       * Write a React application that draws two cards on the page that increase and decrease in size based on an infinitely increasing counter:
       *  - The counter initializes to 0 and increments by 1 every second
       *  - The current counter value is displayed in the top left corner of the screen as a block-level element
       *  - Two cards are drawn on the page below the counter, each 100px squares
       *  - The cards are spaced evenly on the width such that there is equal space between and around them
       *  - Each card has a 1px black border
       *  - Each card is assigned a label (you can choose the label); this label is static for the application lifetime
       *  - Each card is assigned a randomly generated integer between 2 and 6, inclusive; this integer is static after initialization
       *  - The label and integer assigned to a card are displayed inside the card
       *  - The contents of a card are centered vertically and horizontally
       *  - A card increases in size to 150px when the counter value is a factor of the card's assigned integer
       *  - Changes in card size animate over a second (you choose the animation)
